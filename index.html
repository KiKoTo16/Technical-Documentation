      C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET.
      </p>

      <p>
        C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components.
        </li>
        <li>
         Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.

      <p>
       C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about the assembly's types, version, and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The CLR performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code to native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services related to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code that's executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as "managed code." "Unmanaged code," is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform.

     The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:
      <code
        >using System;

class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
    }
}
      </code>

    <header>Types and Variables</header>
    <p>
     A type defines the structure and behavior of any data in C#. The declaration of a type may include its members, base type, interfaces it implements, and operations permitted for that type. A variable is a label that refers to an instance of a specific type.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two kinds of types in C#: value types and reference types. Variables of value types directly contain their data. Variables of reference types store references to their data, the latter being known as objects. With reference types, it's possible for two variables to reference the same object and possible for operations on one variable to affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, the variables each have their own copy of the data, and it isn't possible for operations on one to affect the other (except for ref and out parameter variables).
    </p>
    <p>
     An identifier is a variable name. An identifier is a sequence of unicode characters without any whitespace. An identifier may be a C# reserved word, if it's prefixed by @. Using a reserved word as an identifier can be useful when interacting with other languages.
    </p>
    <p>C#'s value types are further divided into simple types, enum types, struct types, nullable value types, and tuple value types. C#'s reference types are further divided into class types, interface types, array types, and delegate types.</p>

     The following outline provides an overview of C#'s type system:
      <p>
       Simple types<code>Signed integral: sbyte, short, int, long
Unsigned integral: byte, ushort, uint, ulong
Unicode characters: char, which represents a UTF-16 code unit
IEEE binary floating-point: float, double
High-precision decimal floating-point: decimal
Boolean: bool, which represents Boolean valuesâ€”values that are either true or false</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Enum types<code>User-defined types of the form enum E {...}. An enum type is a distinct type with named constants. Every enum type has an underlying type, which must be one of the eight integral types. The set of values of an enum type is the same as the set of values of the underlying type.</code>
      </p>
      <p>
       Struct types<code>User-defined types of the form struct S {...}</code>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nullable value types<code>Extensions of all other value types with a null value</code>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tuple value types<code>User-defined types of the form (T1, T2, ...)</code>

   <section class="main-section" id="Reference_types">
    <header>Reference types</header>
      <p>
       Class types<code>Ultimate base class of all other types: object
Unicode strings: string, which represents a sequence of UTF-16 code units

      </p>
     <p>
       Interface types<code>User-defined types of the form interface I {...}</code>

      <p>
        The key organizational concepts in C# are programs, namespaces, types, members, and assemblies. Programs declare types, which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. Classes, structs, and interfaces are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples of members.
      </p>

      <p>
       When C# programs are compiled, they're physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies typically have the file extension .exe or .dll, depending on whether they implement applications or libraries, respectively.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>
      <p> As a small example, consider an assembly that contains the following code:</p>
      <code
        >using System;

namespace Acme.Collections
{
    public class Stack<T>
    {
        Entry _top;
        
        public void Push(T data)
        {
            _top = new Entry(_top, data);
        }

        public T Pop()
        {
            if (_top == null)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException();
            }
            T result = _top.Data;
            _top = _top.Next;
            
            return result;
        }

        class Entry
        {
            public Entry Next { get; set; }
            public T Data { get; set; }
            
            public Entry(Entry next, T data)
            {
                Next = next;
                Data = data;
            }
        }
    }
}</code>
        <p> The fully qualified name of this class is Acme.Collections.Stack. The class contains several members: a field named top, two methods named Push and Pop, and a nested class named Entry. The Entry class further contains three members: a field named next, a field named data, and a constructor. The Stack is a generic class. It has one type parameter, T that is replaced with a concrete type when it's used.
     </p>
        <p> A stack is a "first in - last out" (FILO) collection. New elements are added to the top of the stack. When an element is removed, it's removed from the top of the stack. The previous example declares the Stack type that defines the storage and behavior for a stack. You can declare a variable that refers to an instance of the Stack type to use that functionality.
        </p>
        <p> Assemblies contain executable code in the form of Intermediate Language (IL) instructions, and symbolic information in the form of metadata. Before it's executed, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler of .NET Common Language Runtime converts the IL code in an assembly to processor-specific code.</p>
        <p>Because an assembly is a self-describing unit of functionality containing both code and metadata, there's no need for #include directives and header files in C#. The public types and members contained in a particular assembly are made available in a C# program simply by referencing that assembly when compiling the program. For example, this program uses the Acme.Collections.Stack class from the acme.dll assembly:</p>
        <code> using System;
using Acme.Collections;

class Example
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var s = new Stack<int>();
        s.Push(1); // stack contains 1
        s.Push(10); // stack contains 1, 10
        s.Push(100); // stack contains 1, 10, 100
        Console.WriteLine(s.Pop()); // stack contains 1, 10
        Console.WriteLine(s.Pop()); // stack contains 1
        Console.WriteLine(s.Pop()); // stack is empty
    }
          }</code>
          <p>To compile this program, you would need to reference the assembly containing the stack class defined in the earlier example.</p>
          <p> C# programs can be stored in several source files. When a C# program is compiled, all of the source files are processed together, and the source files can freely reference each other. Conceptually, it's as if all the source files were concatenated into one large file before being processed. Forward declarations are never needed in C# because, with few exceptions, declaration order is insignificant. C# doesn't limit a source file to declaring only one public type nor does it require the name of the source file to match a type declared in the source file.</p>
